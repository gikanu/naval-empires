web based grand strategy game

This project is my way of paying homage to some of the alltime greats like Civ, Pirates Gold! or EU. But nostalgia doesn't have to dictate the game's look or feel. I'm looking for a way to bridge the gap between old and new. 

Since the target platform is the web browser why not risk a more "material design"-oriented approach to the UI?
